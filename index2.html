    <span class="text-muted">Color</span></h3>

  <p class="lead">Color is important. By default text is black and 
    the background color of the page is white. This is rather harsh and doesn't look that great. You can do better!  
  </p>

  <p>Style the <code>color</code> and <code>background-color</code> 
    on the body tag in your stylesheet. Use colors with good contrast. 
    Check your colors with the <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/">contrast checker</a>.

  <h3 id="challenge-6">Challenge 6 - 
    <span class="text-muted">Links</span></h3>

  <p class="lead">Links are important. They need to stand out from the 
    text around them and let visitors know that something is clickable and will lead to more information. 
  </p>

  <p>Links by default are blue and have an underline. <mark>You can change 
    both of these things for an improvement!</mark> Links also have 
    styles that apply to their <em>interactive states</em> - 
    <code>:hover</code>, <code>:active</code>, and <code>:visited</code>. 
    <strong>You should set a style for each of these.</strong> 
  </p>

  <div>
    <p>This paragraph contains links to the various sections on this page. 
      If you have gotten this far you have <a href="#challenge-1">created a stylesheet</a>, 
      then you defined a <a href="#challenge-2">base font</a>, next it was 
      <a href="#challenge-3">heading styles</a>, followed by 
      <a href="#challenge-4">inline styles</a>, and then 
      <a href="#challenges-5">colors.</a> 
    </p>
  </div>

  <p>You should style the <code>:hover</code>, <code>:active</code>, 
    and <code>:visited</code> pseudo classes.

  <h3 id="challenge-7">Challenge 7 - 
    <span class="text-muted">Blockquotes</span></h3>

  <p class="lead">Blocks quotes are used present a quoted block of 
    text. Usually, you'll also add a citation which says where the quote came from or who it is attributed to.
  </p>

  <p>The <code>blockquote</code> is a tag used to say something is 
    quoted from another source. The <code>cite</code> tag is used to 
    reference the author or source of a creative work. 
    When including quoted work you'll usually use both in conjunction 
    with these to make a good looking blockquote. Take a look at the 
    markup used by <a href="https://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/typography-base.html#blockquotes">Foundation</a> 
    and <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/content/typography/#blockquotes">Bootstrap</a>.
    Then write some styles for the blockquote and the cite tag when it appears inside a blockquote. 
    Keep your eye on the example blockquotes below. I've marked up the quoted text below with the p and cite tags inside the blockquote.
  </p>

  <p>The blockquote default style includes (a lot of) margin on the 
    left and right. <em>You can change this if you like!</em> Take 
    a look at some these <a href="https://1stwebdesigner.com/css-snippets-blockquotes/">examples</a>
    for ideas.

  <h3 id="challenge-8">Challenge 8 - 
      <span class="text-muted">Divider styles</span></h3>

  <p class="lead">The <code>hr</code> tag (horizontal rule) draws a line across the page. It signifies a 
    division in the page. This could be a thematic shift or change of topic. 
  </p>

  <p>By default the <code>hr</code> has a border style. You can change it!

  <h3 id="challenge-9">Challenge 9 - 
      <span class="text-muted">Lead style</span></h3>

  <p class="lead">Sometimes we will want to have a <em>lead</em> style. This can be 
  the first paragraph in section or just an alternate style to 
make a paragraph standout. Take a look at how 
<a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/content/typography/#lead">Bootstrap uses lead</a>.</p>

<p>Style "lead" by styling the class: lead. Easiest is to change the 
  <code>font-size</code>, and or <code>color</code>.</p>

<pre>
<code>
.lead {
  /* Your styles */
}
</code>
</pre>

<h3 id="challenge-10">Challenge 10 - 
  <span class="text-muted">Muted text</span></h3>

  <p class="lead">Sometimes you'll want to create some text that feels 
    secondary to the text it is paired with. </p>

<p>Follow <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/content/typography/#customizing-headings">Bootstrap's example</a>. 
  Use a class name: <code>.text-muted</code>. You can see this 
style used in the second half each heading on this page and 
in the sample text below.</p>


<pre>
  <code>
  .text-muted {
    /* some styles here */
  }
  </code>
  </pre>
  
  <div>
    <h1>A Heading with some <span class="text-muted">Muted Text</span></h1>
    <p>This paragraph uses the regular/default styles.</p>
    <p class="text-muted">This paragraph uses the <code>.text-muted</code> class.</p>
  </div>


  <code>
    body {
    ...
    color: #eee;
    ...
    }

    h1 {
    font-size: 2.5em;
    }

    etc.
  </code>
